expire and purge modules

varnish http accelerator integration

# traditionally

shorter TTLs
- can't override
- 15mins, too long?

mass invalidation
- not performant

Manual search and invalidation
- too much manpower
- may miss stuff

manipulate page headers
- What actually triggers the change??
- learning curve for content team

Not enterprise level solutions.

# what now

tagged cache invalidation


x-invalidates
x-invalidated-by

Only sent to varnish, not to end user. Are deprecated by apache.

## Cache API Drupal 8

Cache tags
invalidation
cleaner api


# Q&A

## views content cache
:-( have to patch core

## examples

With HTTP cache tag auto
hook_entity_load - invalidates more pages (could catch too many). This one is better
or hook_entity_view - doesn't catch everything.

Entity reference support :-)

## Still time to make d8 better

## Ajax
don't use it too much

## accidentally invalidate a lot/ whole site
log to memcache the tags??
expire x now and y in 15 mins

## specific block for an individual anon user

Also cache with user or role tag

## https
varnish 3 has better https support and gzipping files
