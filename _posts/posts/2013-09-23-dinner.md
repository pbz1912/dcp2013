Went to the bar and spoke to a lot of people some I already know others I didn't.

Went to a beer garden with a lot of Drupallers.

Spoke to John who works at the National Theatre. They are also gov funded non-profit. They want someone to go over and
convince them that it is good to bring the development in house.

Food was great.
