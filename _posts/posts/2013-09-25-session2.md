HAL JSON
REST module - not enabled by default when installing Drupal
serializer is separate.

hypermedia
- decoupling uri structure
  - link relations

entity reference, but no documentation
pagination in view - needs work still

configuration entities not supported, would be cool though

patch instead of put - replace it as is - doesn't make sense for D8

no viewmode support - could be in contrib
