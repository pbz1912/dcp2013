SOLID - Good API
does 1 thing - S - single responsibility principle
never changes can be extended - O - Open/closed principle
behaves like a contract - L - Liskov substitution principle
I - Interface segregation
depends on abstractions - D - dependancy inversion
can tell if an abstraction is good if it is reusable

Good OO code tends to be SOLID


---

# Bad API
global variables
depending on specifics of implementation
hidden dependancies
focus on performance over everything else

S - singletons - like LOTR ring of power
T - tight coupling - change on bit and another breaks that 'shouldd' be unconnected
U -
P - premature optimisation
I
D

Tacit Knowledge is high - cost of OO
