# 2000
 - overridable markup
# 2001
default markup
 - only override some of it.
# 2003
 - template based theming xtemplate
# 2005
 - phptemplate
 - logic in templates
 - preprocess functions
# 2007
- theme registry
- preprocessed functions that are called that
 - alter all of the things
  - abstract structure
   - render array
# 2009
 many apis
 brittle
 evil :-P

# DC-Denver time 2012
start again with what we need

## What we need..
- template based markup that can be extended and overridden
- Abstracted structure
- sensible accessible API

killed process layer

# Currently - D8

issue 1757550 - TWIG - templates rather than concatinated strings
issue 2004872 - theme architecture changes - rename preprocess to prepare.
issue 1886448 - theme registry into a proper service
issue 2006152 - theme() deprecation

# Future - D9!
Render API to OO
issue 1843798

Builder and decorator design patterns

Builder - collect all ingredients then invoked at the end
hook_node_view
hook_page_alter
act like this

Decorator
behaviour added to object at runtime
like preprocessors
